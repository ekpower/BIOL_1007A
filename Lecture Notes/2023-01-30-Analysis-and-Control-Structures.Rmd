### Load in data:
```{r}
dryadData <- read.table(file="/Users/emilypower/Desktop/BIOL_1007A/Data/NE_amphibians.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
```

### Set up libraries:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
```

### Analyses
  * For experimental designs, you usually have:
    * An **independent/explanatory variable** (x-axis) vs. **dependent/response variable** (y-axis)
  * Continuous vs. discrete variables affect this
    * **Continuous variables** (range of numbers: height, weight, temperature) vs. **discrete/categorical variables** (categories: species, treatments, site)
    
      _        |   _   |  y-axis (response)  |   _
------------- | -------------  |  ------------- | -------------
 _ |  _  |  Continuous  |   Categorical
  x-axis (explanatory) | Continuous  |  Linear regression (scatter plot)  |  logistic regression (curve)
       _       |  Categorical  |  t-test (2 groups), ANOVA (2+)  |  chi-squared (count); table, mosaic plot

```{r}
glimpse(dryadData)
```
### Basic linear regression analysis (2 continuous variables)
  * Is there a relationship between the mean pool hydroperiod and the number of breeding frogs caught?
```{r}
# y ~ x
regModel <- lm(count.total.adults ~ mean.hydro, data=dryadData)
print(regModel)
summary(regModel)
hist(regModel$residuals)

# how much does the variance in x explain the variance in y?
summary(regModel)$"r.squared"
summary(regModel)[["r.squared"]]  # does the same thing as above
# View(summary(regModel))

# a scatter plot to go along with this analysis:
regPlot <- ggplot(data=dryadData, aes(x=mean.hydro, y=count.total.adults+1)) +
  geom_point(size=2) +
  stat_smooth(method="lm", se=0.99)
regPlot + theme_few()
  # "lm" gives linear regression
```

### Basic ANOVA
  * Was there a statistically significant difference in the number of adults among wetlands?
```{r}
ANOmodel <- aov(count.total.adults ~ factor(wetland), data=dryadData)  # aov() is ANOVA function
summary(ANOmodel)
```
**^HAVE TO make sure that the categorical variable you're giving to R is actually categorical, not numbers (eg. use the `factor()` function)**

```{r}
dryadData %>%
  group_by(wetland) %>%
  summarise(avgHydro = mean(count.total.adults, na.rm=T), totalNumber=n())
```

### Boxplot
```{r}
dryadData$wetland <- factor(dryadData$wetland)  # overrides to turn integer to factor
class(dryadData$wetland)  # now a factor

ANOplot <- ggplot(data=dryadData, mapping=aes(x=wetland, y=count.total.adults)) +
  geom_boxplot()
ANOplot
```
#### ^ to see what that looks like between species, use the `fill` argument:
```{r}
ANOplot2 <- ggplot(data=dryadData, mapping=aes(x=wetland, y=count.total.adults, fill=species)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_grey()
ANOplot2
ggsave(file="SpeciesBoxplots.pdf", plot=ANOplot2, device="pdf")
  # saves file to BIOL_1007A folder in desktop
```

### Logistic regression
  * Construct data frame:
    * **gamma probabilities**: continuous variables that are always positive and have a skewed distribution
```{r}
xVar <- sort(rgamma(n=200, shape=5, scale=5))
  # n means we want 200 rgamma values
yVar <- sample(rep(c(1,0), each=100), prob=seq_len(200))
logRegData <- data.frame(xVar, yVar)
```
  * ^ for statistic regression, **yVar** is the categorical variable

### Logistic regression analysis
```{r}
logRegModel <- glm(yVar ~ xVar, 
                   data=logRegData,
                   family=binomial(link=logit))
  # link=logit specifies that we want a logistic regression
summary(logRegModel)

logRegPlot <- ggplot(data=logRegData, aes(x=xVar, y=yVar)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "glm", method.args=list(family=binomial))
  # "glm" gives logistic regression
logRegPlot
```

### Contingency tables (chi-squared) Analysis
  * Are there differences in counts of males and females between species?
```{r}
countData <- dryadData %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(Males=sum(No.males, na.rm=TRUE), Females=sum(No.females, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  select(-species) %>%
  as.matrix()
countData

row.names(countData) = c("SS", "WF")
  # SS = spotted salamander, WF = wood frog
countData  # now has row names

# chi-squared
  # get residuals
testResults <- chisq.test(countData)$residuals  # less males in SS than would be expected, less females in WF than would be expected
```

### Mosaic plot (base R)
```{r}
mosaicplot(x=countData,
           col=c("goldenrod", "grey"),
           shade = FALSE)
```

### Bar plot
  * Prepare data:
```{r}
countDataLong <- countData %>%
  as_tibble() %>%  # computer wants it in tbl format, not matrix
  mutate(Species = c(rownames(countData)))  %>%  # adds species column
  pivot_longer(cols=Males:Females,  # specifies which columns we want longer
              names_to = "Sex",
              values_to = "Count")
```

### Plot bar graph:
```{r}
ggplot(data=countDataLong, mapping=aes(x=Species, y=Count, fill=Sex)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position="dodge") +  # identity prevents it from making automatic histogram; dodge plots bars next to each other
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("magenta", "midnightblue"))
```

## Control Structures

### `if` and `ifelse` statements
  * **if statement** anatomy:
    * if (condition) {expression 1}
    * if (condition) {expression 1} else {expression 2}
      * if the condition is met, do [expression 1]. if not, do [expression 2]
    * if (condition 1) {expression 1} else if (condition 2) {expression 2} else {expression 3}
    * *if there are any final unspecified elses, it captures the rest of the unspecified conditions*
    * *else must appear on the same line of the expression*

#### use it for single values
```{r}
z <- signif(runif(1), digits=2)  # give me one random uniform number thats rounded to the second digit
z > 0.5  # output = TRUE
```

#### use {} or not
```{r}
if (z > 0.8) {cat(z, "is a large number", "\n")} else  # \n = line break
  if (z < 0.2) {cat(z, "is a small number", "\n")} else
  {cat(z, "is a number of typical size", "\n")
    cat("z^2 =", z^2, "\n")
    y <- c(z, TRUE)}
y
# if z is greater than 8, spit back "z is a larger number"
# if it's less than 2, spit back "z is a small number"
# if it's anywhere in between, spit back "z is a number of typical size"
```

### `ifelse` to fill vectors
  * ifelse(condition, yes, no)

**Insect population where females lay 10.2 eggs on average, follows Poisson distribution (discrete probability distribution showing the likely number of times an event will occur). 35% chance of parasitism where no eggs are laid.**
  * *Let's make a distribution for 1000 individuals*
```{r}
tester <- runif(1000)
eggs <- ifelse(tester > 0.35, rpois(n=1000, lambda=10.2), 0)  # if the element of tester is greater than 0.35, give us a random number in the Poisson integer; if not, assign 0
hist(eggs)
```

**Let's say we have a vector of p-values from a simulation and we want to create a vector to highlight the significant ones for plotting.**
  * *working with 2 vectors:*
```{r}
pVals <- runif(1000)
z <- ifelse(pVals <= 0.025, "lowerTail", "nonSig")  # if p value is less than or equal to 0.025, say lowerTail; if not, say nonSig
z
z[pVals >= 0.975] <- "upperTail"
table(z)
# we used a combo of the ifelse() function and subsetting
```

### for looops: workhorse function for doing repetitive tasks
  * universal in all computer languages, not just R
  * controversial in R because:
    * often not necessary (vectorization in R)
    * very slow with certain operations
    * family of apply functions

### Anatomy of for loop:
  * for(var in sequence){*starts the for loop*  
    *body of the for loop*  
    } *end of the for loop*
  * `var` is a counter variable that holds the current value of the loop (i, j, k)
  * sequence` is usually an integer vector that defines start/end of loop
```{r}
for(i in 1:5){
  cat("stuck in a loop", i, "\n")
  cat(3+2, "\n")
  cat(3+i, "\n")
}
  # 5 stays constant; whatever you reference in i makes things difference in that loop
print(i)  # prints what the loop ends on (5)
```

### Use a counter variable that maps to the position of each element
```{r}
my_dogs <- c("chow", "akita", "malamute", "husky", "samoyed")
for(i in 1:length(my_dogs)) {
  cat("i=", i, "my_dogs[i]=", my_dogs[i], "\n")
}
```

### Use double for loops

#### Loop over rows
```{r}
m <- matrix(round(runif(20), digits=2), nrow=5)

for (i in 1:nrow(m)) {
  m[i,] <- m[i,] + i  # for every row, take values in that row and add [1, 2, 3...] to it
}
m  # 1st row got 1 added to everything, 2nd got 2 added to everything...etc.
```

### Loop over columns
```{r}
m <- matrix(round(runif(20), digits=2), nrow=5)
for(j in 1:ncol(m)){
  m[,j] <- m[,j] + j  # good practice to use i for rows and j for columns
}
m
```

### Loop over rows and columns
```{r}
m <- matrix(round(runif(20), digits=2), nrow=5)

for(i in 1:nrow(m)){
  for (j in 1:ncol(m)){
    m[i,j] <- m[i,j] + i + j
  }
}
m
```

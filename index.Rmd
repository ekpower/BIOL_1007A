### Dear Reader,  
  Hi! My name is Emily (she/her) and I am a senior feb at Middlebury College majoring in Conservation Biology and minoring in Psychology. This J term (2023), I'm taking a class called *Reproducible Biology in R* where I'm learning the basics of reproducible coding in R and RStudio that I can apply in my future biology courses and research. This webpage serves as a repository for my assignments and a potential resource for other Biology students out there!

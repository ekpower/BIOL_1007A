## Using publicly available data  
1. Go to [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/search) to choose a published paper and data set and reconstruct your own figure. Code a `ggplot` graph that looks as close to the published figure as you can.  
  * *My data were gathered from this [Dryad page](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.hg000c2)*
  * *Here's the link to the [original article](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0199940)*

**This is the figure I am attempting to replicate:**
![](/Users/emilypower/Desktop/BIOL_1007A/Images/UV_graph.png){width=30%}

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
UV_data <- read.table(file="/Users/emilypower/Desktop/BIOL_1007A/Data/UV Data-Hammond copy.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
glimpse(UV_data)

clean_UV <- UV_data[complete.cases(UV_data[,9]),]  # get rid of UV threshold NA values

UV_hist <- ggplot(clean_UV, aes(x=UV_Threshold_μW)) +  # gather data
  geom_histogram(bins=9, fill="cyan", color="black", center=12) +  # this center is the closest I could get to match the original figure, but the bars around x=30 are still not quite accurate; bins = number of bars
  xlab("UV detection at 315 nm (energy in μwatts)") +  # label x axis
  ylab("Number of subjects") +  # label y axis
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18), expand = c(0,0)) +  # generate values on y axis and have bars touch x axis
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(10,20,30,40), expand = c(0,0)) + # generate values on x axis and have bars touch y axis
  theme_base(base_family="Arial")  # set chart theme and font
# how do I make the bars align with the tick marks on the x axis?
# still a bit confused how center= works
UV_hist

```
